# Music-Player
## My First IOS App
I saw a youtube tutorial for creating a Music Player online. 

Reference youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiXvvL1wNUc&list=PLkl5C2-yH_BLvfH81DNzjZ5yIUtHZUY8m&index=3&t=1221s

The main changes I will be making:
* Modifying the UI and functionalities to make it my own & to learn about swift UI

Steps taken:
* Learn Swift Language Programming Fundamentals from resources LinkedIn Learning, Youtube, StackOverflow 
* Learn SwiftUI basics from Apple documentation tutorial, Youtube 

List of current changes I have made from initial youtube tutorial:
* UI
* Added a previous song button
